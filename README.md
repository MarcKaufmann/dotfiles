# dotfiles

This is largely built on a subset of [Bogdan Popa's dotiles](https://github.com/Bogdanp/dotfiles): 

## Setup 

1. Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)
    - Install Xcode manually first?
2. `sudo port install git`

## Manual Checklist

- Map capslock to Ctrl
- Install 1Password and browser extension
- pinboard browser extension: 
    - pull up the [pinboard bookmarklet](https://pinboard.in/howto/) to the bookmarks toolbar, which has to be visible
- Install RStudio
- Install Racket
- Install Doom Emacs
    - Much of that can be automated, once there is no bug anymore
- Move all my repositories to GitHub. Stop having duplicates across github and gitlab.
    - Obviously back them up regularly to my server
- Remap Capslock to Ctrl
- Install 1Password

## todo

- Create repo for new dotfiles on github. Remove old one probably.
- Install Doom Emacs and configure (ESS modes etc)
- Install latex
- Configure tmux
- Install Anki
- vi mode on the cli
